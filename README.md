# BrigDrake

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/lovethedrake/brigdrake/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/lovethedrake/brigdrake)

__BrigDrake__ provides Drake pipeline support for
[Brigade](https://brigade.sh/).

## THIS PROJECT HIGHLY VOLATILE!

brigdrake implements the highly volatile
[DrakeSpec](https://github.com/lovethedrake/drakespec) and, as such is, itself,
highly volatile. Users are warned that breaking changes to this software are
likely at any point up until its eventual 1.0 release.

Additionally, the `master` branch of this project is Brigade v2-compatible (and
not compatible with Brigade v.1x). Brigade v2, itself, remains a
work-in-progress at this time, further contributing to this project's
volatility.

# Installation

First install [Brigade v2](https://github.com/brigadecore/brigade/tree/v2) then
Drake-enable any Brigade 2 project by using
`lovethedrake/brigdrake:<placeholder>` as your worker image.

More comprehensive instructions are will be forthcoming as this project
gradually begins to stabilize.
